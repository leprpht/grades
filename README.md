***Probably functional but I'm not sure yet.***

Allows to manage large groups of students, store their data: *full name, major and birthdate*.

Has a fully functional GUI. It's `ugly`, but it does its job.

For demonstration purposes it generates random students with random backgrounds into the student list. The number of generated entries can be changed in the `src/GeneratorSetup.txt` by inserting a value up to **300**. To disable the generator just input **0**.
